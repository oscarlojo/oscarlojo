## Hi, I'm @oscarlojo

- 🧠 I spend my days convincing data to reveal its secrets (sometimes with threats).
- 📊 Turning coffee into insights since... well, let's not get into timelines.
- 🧪 Turning messy data into slightly less messy data. Miracles take a bit longer.
- 🤝 Always open to collaborating on Data Science projects, as long as there are memes involved.
- 🐍 Fluent in Python, sarcasm, and obscure error messages.
- 🤖 Automation enthusiast — because clicking manually is so last season.

> “Trust me, I’m *definitely* not just googling the error messages.”
